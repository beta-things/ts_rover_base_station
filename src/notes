TODO SOFTWARE
- a* or NavFN implementation with orientation filter to keep wires behind the unit
- API for shot calling
- Joystick operation  


TODO HARDWARE
- Planetary gear motors with OMNI wheels
- Modern CPU onboard
- LIDar control board and CAN bus board in one? 
- e-stop buttons 


-This past couple weeks I've been working to get all the control software running on the SBC but it's not capable. Even with 50% CPU usage any dropped frames 
on the part of the position solver or the local path planner make for large insurmountable nav issues. Currently ethernet wired with the majority of software running on the 
TCH. Will need to run better compute on the final as the control should not be network dependent for safety reasons. 

-Coming up is more work on making setup easier and faster * then probable API for Kyle to hook into for shot calling and then joystick control. 
*-Room scanning with VR tracking instead of AMCL 
-rotational trimming of tracker and LIDAR using a calibration sequence
-Simple api for shot calling only. more complex movements will require an edited version of RVIZ
-Joystick control that still respects operating envelope and collision detection
-Add AMCl tracking to the sensor fusion for still better accuracy
